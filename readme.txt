As basic as I could make it app using express, pug, webpack.
Just for using modules in the brower, scss to css and browser sync.



To get up and running with browser sync.

1. From cli, "npm build".
2. From, another cli, "node app.js".
3. From first cli, "npm run build-watch"

Edit any .pug, .scss or .js in /src directory.
Webpack will compile on edits (I think just incrementally???).
Browsersync will do it's shinizzle.
Happiness.
