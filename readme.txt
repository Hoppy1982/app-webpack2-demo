To get up and running with browser sync.

1. From cli, "npm build".
2. From, another cli, "node app.js".
3. From first cli, "npm run build-watch"

Edit any .pug, .scss or .js in /src directory.
Webpack will compile on edits (I think just incrementally???).
Browsersync will do it's shinizzle.
Happiness.
